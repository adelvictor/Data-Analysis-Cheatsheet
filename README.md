## Descriptive Statistics
- Measures of Central Tendency
    - Mean - Sensitive to outliers
    - Median - Less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean
    - Mode - Important measure of central tendency for categorical data
- Measures of Dispersion
    - Range - Sensitive to Outliers
    - Interquartile Range - Less sensitive to outliers compared to the Range
    - Standard Deviation
    - Variance 
- Measures of Position
    - Quartiles
    - Percentiles
 

## Probalbility
- Probability Rules
    - Complement Rule
    - Addition Rule - Applies to events that are mutually exclusive
    - Multiplication Rule - Applies to events that are independent
